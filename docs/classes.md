# ðŸ–Š Classes

Clicker.js has 2 main DOM classes, as of version 1, ClickerElement and ClickerElementList. They mainly differ in the fact that one stores multiple elements, while the other stores one element.



Clicker.js also has 2 classes built to work with save data, DataStore and DataInterface. DataStore is for a sessionStorage like ability to store data. DataInterface is there to act as a higher abstraction that can simply control more parts of the data simply.
